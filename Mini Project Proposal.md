# Mini Project Proposal 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I watched chess streamers and YouTube videos to pass the time. Since then, I have started playing chess with my friends and teammates at college. Chess is becoming more popular than ever with its growth across YouTube, streamers, and the realese of shows like The Queen's Gambit. Using my economics background, I plan to study the relationship between where top chess players are from and the development of their home country. Similar studies have been done regarding other sports like soccer and basketball, but not chess. I plan on using FIDE chess data from 2014-2024 which can be downloaded from their website and various economic development indicators from the World Bank. Some of these indicators will include GDP per capita, interest rates, and an overall development index that rank orders countries by development based on multiple factors. I plan to use multiple two-way fixed effects regression models. I chose these models to attempt and control for any unseen endogeneity that may be country or time specific.  One of my models will predict the country of the chess player using my economic development variables. Another will predict the rating of players also based on my economic variables. I want to use two models first to see how economic development plays in the overall number of countries with great chess players. While also looking at the relationship between development and the top echelon of “super GMs”.
